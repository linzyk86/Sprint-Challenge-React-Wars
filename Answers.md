1. What is React JS and what problems does it solve? Support your answer with concepts introduced in class and from your personal research on the web.

React JS is a Javascript library that makes it easier to build projects by using state, props, and components.

2. Describe component state.

State is the current state a component is in and tracks the changes.  It's like a 'count' variable.

3. Describe props.

Props are properties you set and pass into components to use.

4. What are side effects, and how do you sync effects in a React component to changes of certain state or props?

Side effects are things that happen outside of the function, and can change the state and props, like getting info from an  api. You sync effects by using useEffect.
